Challenge - Beware of Monty Hall

## I see the Monty Hall problem as one where your choice of picking a winning door is improved after the Host reveals the bad door.

The host's input might be used in Bayes Theorem.  Here are the given facts:
     
__Initial Probability you will select the prize: 1/3__
__Initial Probability you will NOT select the prize is: 2/3__

After the Host reveals his door your odds of picking a __wrong__ door decreases to 50%

__New Probability you will NOT select the prize is now: 1/2__
